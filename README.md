Designer developer and web development consultant @NickolasBoyer. I’m mainly working with Vue.js these days with a strong focus on PWA's.

::: slot about
Who am I? 

Well I am many things, I am passionate about digital design and development which is a big part of my live. 

I like traveling, long-term. I am not a tourist.

I am an avid kitesurfer and runner, I also like squash but to be honest I still really suck. 

I am a big fan of meditation, mindfulness and stoicism. A few of my favourite authors: Tim Urban, Seneca the Young, Sam Harris, Jesse Frederik & Tim Ferriss.

Finally I am an amateur IOT electrical engineer and occasionally produce some futuristic funky tech tunes. 

I am not sure, I love doubt, most people are too sure about things, strong opinions held loosely, I love that.

I am a work in progress, I love to take on ambitious projects that venture into area’s I’m unfamiliar with. I’m really interested in the intersection of web technologies with other areas such as sociology-anthropology and music.

I love a challenge, I try to steer towards discomfort. It’s not about what pleasures you want in your live it’s about what kind of struggles you want.

I am also curious about who you are, feel free to contact me, I’d love to hear from you... ↓
