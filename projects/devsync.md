# Devsync

When designing website's I would always be messing with the style of elements trough the browser's devtools. This enabled me to quickly see what styles would look like, without constantly switching context. But... I kept having to copy these edits to my editor, and often losing them in the process.

I wanted to create a way to preserve these edits and design in a more visual way so my design was based on what looks proper instead of the values I kept changing in my editor until it looked decent.

This is what Devsync does. It allows you to design visually using a Sketch/Figma like editor that lives in your browser's devtools and it applies these changes in real-time through your editor by automatically editing your project's CSS.
