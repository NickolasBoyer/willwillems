# Whoishiring.me

Whoishiring.me is one of the first web dev side projects I ever built. It's a simple subscribable search machine for the monthly “Who is hiring?” posted on Hacker News. 

The project briefly reached #1 on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16743030) when it launched instantly collecting around 1,000 subscribers in its first day.

Whoishiring.me is currently hosted on Netlify where it auto-rebuilds every month.
