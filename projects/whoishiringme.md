# Whoishiring.me

Whoishiring.me is a simple subscribable search machine for the monthly “Who is hiring?” posted on Hacker News.

Whoishiring.me is currently hosted on Firebase hosting while the backend is managed by Google App Engine, there is still a lot to improve though. Currently we are using Sparkpost which we migrated to after using a custom system for a while. So far the hosting of this app has cost $0.00 in total.
