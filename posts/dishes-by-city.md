# Dishes by city

I wouldn't consider myself that much of a foodie but more of a person suffering from a strong culinary FOMO, thus I end up visiting a lot of restaurants in the cities that I stay in. This often ends up with me strongly associating a city with my respective favourite dish/culinary experience. 

I'm not claiming these dishes are the best ones you'll find in the city, though they certainly are very good. Most of these will be vegetarian so if you are, don't worry. Here they are:
