# Store patterns in Svelte: Gitlab's Vuex

THIS IS A PUBLIC DRAFT

When your JS project gets big you often end up needing a data store. With larger apps or SPA's this can get to complex really easy. When working with Vue I try to stick to [Gitlab's Vuex Frontend Development Guideline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vuex.html). A guide that aims to provide structure and order when working with Vuex, Vue.js' store.

For more technical web projects development I've recently become very fond of Svelte. It allows for much more versatility, flexibility and makes my technical project more maintainable and reduces development time.

However working with Svelte's stores can become chaotic if you yourself don't apply any structure. In order to fix this I decided to port Gitlab's Vuex example to Svelte's stores.

Here is the result:

<iframe title="Gitlab's Vuex guide for Svelte" src="https://svelte.dev/repl/939579262de34b00b97873f2e61cd3b0?version=3.19.2" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## Summary of Gitlab's philosophy
They:

Steer you towards proper application design:

> The first thing you should do before writing any code is to design the state.

Work with a *useful* separation of concerns:

> When a user clicks on an action, we need to dispatch it. This action will commit a mutation that will change the state.

With a no-BS real world-based approach:

> Remember that actions only describe that something happened, they donâ€™t describe how the application state changes.

Have super solid [Action naming](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vuex.html#actions-pattern-request-and-receive-namespaces) guidelines:

> 1. An action requestSomething, to toggle the loading state
> 2. An action receiveSomethingSuccess, to handle the success callback
> 3. An action receiveSomethingError, to handle the error callback
> 4. An action fetchSomething to make the request.

I highly recommend you read the [Gitlab guide itself](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vuex.html) if you have ever used Vue but it's not needed to read this article (although it does make it easier).

## The Vuex actions
Since Gitlab uses *only* actions to interface with the store (very sensible) you'll find all the "exposed" functions here.

> Never commit a mutation directly from a component

You can find the entire code here but we'll cut some stuff out to make it a bit more readable so you can scroll past this one

```js
  import * as types from './mutation_types';
  import axios from '~/lib/utils/axios_utils';
  import createFlash from '~/flash';

  export const requestUsers = ({ commit }) => commit(types.REQUEST_USERS);
  export const receiveUsersSuccess = ({ commit }, data) => commit(types.RECEIVE_USERS_SUCCESS, data);
  export const receiveUsersError = ({ commit }, error) => commit(types.RECEIVE_USERS_ERROR, error);

  export const fetchUsers = ({ state, dispatch }) => {
    dispatch('requestUsers');

    axios.get(state.endpoint)
      .then(({ data }) => dispatch('receiveUsersSuccess', data))
      .catch((error) => {
        dispatch('receiveUsersError', error)
        createFlash('There was an error')
      });
  }

  export const requestAddUser = ({ commit }) => commit(types.REQUEST_ADD_USER);
  export const receiveAddUserSuccess = ({ commit }, data) => commit(types.RECEIVE_ADD_USER_SUCCESS, data);
  export const receiveAddUserError = ({ commit }, error) => commit(types.REQUEST_ADD_USER_ERROR, error);

  export const addUser = ({ state, dispatch }, user) => {
    dispatch('requestAddUser');

    axios.post(state.endpoint, user)
      .then(({ data }) => dispatch('receiveAddUserSuccess', data))
      .catch((error) => dispatch('receiveAddUserError', error));
  }
```

Gitlab first defines their state mutations in basic actions and then compose these together in bigger and more useful "service" actions that are actually used in the application.

To make this example a bit more readable I'm going to simplify this a bit but in practice you should do this to. We'll end up with a Svelte store that also uses this pattern, but a bit more strict.

Secondly I'll temporarily remove the `addUser` function. It doesn't do anything much different from `fetchUsers` and reduces the LOC you have to scan through by 50%.

```js
  import * as types from './mutation_types';
  import axios from '~/lib/utils/axios_utils';
  import createFlash from '~/flash';

  export const fetchUsers = ({ state, commit, dispatch }) => {
    commit(types.REQUEST_USERS)

    axios.get(state.endpoint)
      .then(({ data }) => commit(types.RECEIVE_USERS_SUCCESS, data))
      .catch((error) => {
        commit(types.RECEIVE_USERS_ERROR, error)
        createFlash('There was an error')
      });
  }
```
I've you've ever worked with finite state machines this might kinda remind you of them, essentially the following is happening:

1. The function `fetchUsers` is executed from a component.
2. `REQUEST_USERS` is committed to the store.
3. The API request is made.
4. On succes or error respectively `RECEIVE_USERS_SUCCESS` and `RECEIVE_USERS_ERROR` are committed passing along the relevant data.

Let's see what these commits do, I've excluded the other commits here:

```js
 export default {
    [types.REQUEST_USERS](state) {
      state.isLoading = true;
    },
    [types.RECEIVE_USERS_SUCCESS](state, data) {
      // Do any needed data transformation to the received payload here
      state.users = data;
      state.isLoading = false;
    },
    [types.RECEIVE_USERS_ERROR](state, error) {
      state.isLoading = false;
    }
 };

```
With the first commit the loading state is activated, this one is used before making the actual request.

Then using the second or third request the loading state is deactivated and the data is processed or the error handled depending on whether the request was successfully.

Pretty straightforward right? Finally, the state. Since it's quite small I'm including it in it's entirety here:


``` js
export default () => ({
	endpoint: null,
	
	isLoading: false,
	error: null,
	
	isAddingUser: false,
	errorAddingUser: false,
	
	users: [],
});

```

## Porting the Vuex example to Svelte

Ok that was a lot of Vuex code, let's move on to Svelte.

Fortunately it's best to explain these stores from high to low level but to design them the other way around. So we'll do the state first:

``` js
import { writable } from 'svelte'

export const endpoint = null

export const isLoading 					= writable(false)
export const error     					= writable(null)

export const isAddingUser				= writable(false)
export const errorAddingUser			= writable(false)

export const users						= writable([])
```
I'm using a `const` variable for the endpoint since it's not going to change (one of the first subtle signs of Svelte's flexibility).

Svelte's [writables](https://svelte.dev/docs#writable) are its default store mechanisms. Besides `writable` you've got `readable` and `derived` (which would be a getter in Vuex).

<!--What I love about this way of defining state is that it's way more flexible, customisable and it works much better with Typescript.-->

Let's add some actions:

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte'

export const endpoint 					= 'https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries'

export const isLoading 					= writable(false)
export const error     					= writable(null)

export const isAddingUser				= writable(false)
export const errorAddingUser			= writable(false)

export const users				  		= writable([])

export const requestUsers = () => isLoading.set(true)
export const receiveUsersSuccess = (data) => {
	// Do any needed data transformation to the received payload here
	users.set(data)
	isLoading.set(false)
}
export const receiveUsersError = (error) => {
	// handle error
	isLoading.set(false)
}
```
I'm a big fan of keeping these two in the same file since it encourages me to keep the store "modules" small and simple but separate them if you want.

We will be importing the store variables to use in our components but not the functions that mutate the store data, we'll use these *only* in our "actions" though I like to call them services and separate them in `store` (state & state mutations) and `service` (actions) folders.

```js
import { endpoint, requestUsers, receiveUsersSuccess, receiveUsersError } from './store'
import createFlash from '~/flash'

export const fetchUsers = () => {
    requestUsers()

    axios.get(endpoint)
      .then(({ data }) => receiveUsersSuccess(data))
      .catch((error) => {
        receiveUsersError(error)
        createFlash('There was an error')
      });
  }
```

The `requestUsers` name looks a bit weird like this, I would slightly rename this to be more clear but apart from this we're done! You can check out the entire working example [here](https://svelte.dev/repl/939579262de34b00b97873f2e61cd3b0?version=3.19.2) which includes a basic UI to interact with the store and service.

## Final thoughts

Some things from the GL guide are not useful in Svelte. Due to svelte stores just being regular JS/TS and them being imported like this there is no need for separate mutation types.

> Use mutation types instead of hardcoding strings. It will be less error prone.

In this case Svelte is less error prone by default.
