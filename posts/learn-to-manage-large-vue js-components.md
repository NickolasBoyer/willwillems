# Learn to manage large Vue.js components in 4 min

Vue.js is, in my opinion, the nicest JS framework currently available. One of the features I like the most are the `.vue` single-file components. It can get quite hard to manage larger ones tough, especially when you start creating custom sub-components and adding static assets. Here are some things I’ve tried, you might like them too.

_Figure 1: You when handling large components before reading this post._

## Some quick basics

This might be common knowledge to you but just in case:

* Use PascalCase file naming.
  _Example:_ `ComponentName.vue`
  [doc reference](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Single-file-component-filename-casing-strongly-recommended)
* Preface base components with a default word like App, Base or V.
  _Example:_ `AppTable.vue`
  [doc reference](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Base-component-names-strongly-recommended)
* Preface components with a max of one active instance with The.
  _Example:_ `TheLargeComponent.vue`
  [doc reference](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Single-instance-component-names-strongly-recommended)
* Always use multi-word names for your components. Prefacing `App` or `The` simplifies this but do this for all components. This is to avoid clashes with standard HTML tags which are always a single word.
  _Example:_ `MainModal.vue` _instead of_ `Modal.vue`
  [doc reference](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Multi-word-component-names-essential)

## How it is often done.

I’ve seen this all too often, and with large projects this becomes a nightmare. All components are in the `components` folder, all assets are in a central assets folder and single-instance child components are only indicated by prefacing the name of it’s parent (this gets super fun after 2 layers). Often this looks a little like this:

    components
    |--LargeComponent.vue
    |--LargeComponentModal.vue
    |--LargeComponentModalTextSection.vue
    |--LargeComponentModalTextSectionTitle.vue
    |--LargeComponentModalButton.vue
    |--LargeComponentModalButtonText.vue
    assets
    |--img
    |  |--large-component-banner.png
    |  |--large-component-button-bg.png

OK, so this obviously gets cluttered fast, how do we fix this? Let’s get to the first option!

## 1. Putting the component in it’s own folder.

One of the first options I tried. Name the folder `LargeComponent` and put the original component in it. You can do two things here.

First you can name the component `index.vue` which probably works in your build system and has the great benefit of not changing your import statements. This is really really handy but a very hacky and not the most stable solution. **Note: this does not work if you are specifying the file extension in your imports like** `**LargeComponent.vue**`

    components
    |--LargeComponent
    |  |--index.vue
    |  |--components
    |  |  |--LargeComponentModal.vue
    |  |--assets
    |  |  |--img
    |  |  |  |--banner.png

Secondly you could just name it after it’s parent folder and thus keep it `LargeComponent.vue` which is probably the wisest choice here. This does change the import from `./components/LargeComponent` to `./components/LargeComponent/LargeComponent` which isn’t ideal.

Pro’s

* All items in the components folder indicate and represent a component.
* Easy to understand for other dev’s.
* Sub-components and assets can be imported with clean relative imports: ./assets/img/banner.png

Secondly an approach which looks very much like this one and probably the most straightforward one:

## 2. Putting the folder alongside the vue component.

This solution has no problem with specifying the file extension and does not change the imports.

    components
    |--LargeComponent.vue
    |--LargeComponent
    |  |--components
    |  |  |--LargeComponentModal.vue
    |  |--assets
    |  |  |--img
    |  |  |  |--banner.png

The imports in the file itself do look a bit more complex but are also very clear: `./LargeComponent/assets/img/banner.png`. It also makes the main components folder look a bit more cluttered but not necessarily more unclear.

Pro’s

* Works in every build system, very straightforward.
* Easy to understand for other dev’s.
* Does not change imports when creating folder for component.

Finally there is a bit more uncommon one I really like if you are using imports without file extension specified:

## 3. Putting an index.json in your component folder

Pretty straightforward, you just throw this `index.json` file in your component folder:

    {
      "name": "MY_COMPONENT_NAME",
      "private": true,
      "main": "./MY_COMPONENT_NAME.vue"
    }

This takes care of resolving the import correctly. You can keep a tidy structure in your components folder with every element representing a component. You’ll end up with this folder structure:

    components
    |--LargeComponent
    |  |--index.json
    |  |--LargeComponent.vue
    |  |--components
    |  |  |--LargeComponentModal.vue
    |  |--assets
    |  |  |--img
    |  |  |  |--banner.png

This has all the advantages of the methods above but it is a bit more obscure and looses one of it’s biggest advantages when using imports with file extension specified.

Pro’s

* Does not change imports when creating folder for component.
* All component data contained in one folder.
* Relative imports are cleaner.

## Bonus round: Tip for Vue-Router users

When building an SPA I really like to put the single-instance components in a folder corresponding to the page they belong to, like this:

    views
    |--SubscribeView.vue
    |--SubscribeView
    |  |--components
    |  |  |--TheHeader.vue
    |  |--assets
    |  |  |--header-image.png
    components
    |--AppButton.vue
    |--AppButton
    |  |--components
    |  |  |--AppButtonText.vue
    |  |--assets
    |  |  |--img
    |  |  |  |--button-background.png

That’s it!
