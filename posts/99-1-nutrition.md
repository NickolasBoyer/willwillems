# 99/1 Nutrition: What we all agree about

* [Refined and added simple carbohydrates](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/nutrition/simple-carbs-vs-complex-carbs.html) (includes sugar) are bad and you should eat as little of them as possible.
* You need fats and which ones you consume matters a great deal, exclusively consuming canola oil or soybean oil is bad. Refined oils are worse that non-refined or virgin oils, high heat makes oils unhealthier, this depends on the type of oil.
* Protein is useful if you want to facilitate muscle growth. In this case itâ€™s smart to increase the amount of protein in your diet.
* You need a lot of different micro nutrients (vitamins and minerals) to sustain yourself, not consuming these (or their precursors) will lead to serious medical issues or death.
* One can develop some level insulin resistance if ones diet improperly influences blood sugar levels and this is bad.
* Consistently eating too much or too little calories is bad.
* Eating less than 3 meals a day is not unhealthy.
* Different forms (molecules/precursors) of vitamins can differ enormously in impact ([vitamin A](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/75/5/900/4689405), vitamin D, etc.).
* You do not die if you consume 0 cal but have enough body fat, [even for months granted you consume micro nutrients](https://pmj.bmj.com/content/49/569/203).
